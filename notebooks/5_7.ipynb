    "_Derivation of smoothing splines_ (Green and Silverman, 1994). Suppose that $N \\ge 2$, and that $g$ is the natural cubic spline interpolant to the pairs $\\left\\{x_i, z_i\\right\\}^{N}_{1}$, with $a < x_1 < \\dots < x_N < b$. This is a natural spline with a knot at every $x_i$; being an $N$-dimensional space of functions, we can determine the coefficients such that it interpolates the sequence $z_i$ exactly. Let $\\tilde{g}$ be any other differentiable funciotn on $[a, b]$ that interpolates the $N$ pairs.\n",
